| Queue item | #1 — Triage/fix 10 core-flow e2e failures (checkout ×3, inventory-receive ×3, invoice-pay ×3, logout ×1) |
| Files/areas expected | `web/e2e/*.spec.ts`; possibly terminal/purchasing/finance pages + components if real gaps found. Using ports 3000/3001 + Postgres 5432 (`finder_e2e`) |

## Parallel Non-Overlapping Claim

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Agent/session | Claude session E (desktop app, "next" directive from Sri) |
| Queue item | #4 — RLS gap: request-scoped tenant context (AsyncLocalStorage) so the DB layer sets app.tenant_id on every authenticated query; cross-tenant regression test on real Postgres. Policy stays permissive-when-unset (strict flip deferred until e2e green) |
| Files/areas expected | `src/shared/db.ts`, `src/shared/tenant-context.ts` (new), `src/app.ts` (middleware wiring), new backend test file — backend only, NO `web/**` edits. Embedded Postgres via test harness (no fixed ports) |

## Released Claims (session E, item #3)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Agent/session | Claude session E (desktop app, "next" directive from Sri) |
| Queue item | #3 — Implement ~14 mock-only endpoints on the real backend (inventory transfers/adjustments, team invite/detail, workflow templates, AR-aging sweep, Vendor-360 family ×6) |
| Files/areas expected | `src/modules/inventory/**`, `src/modules/team/**`, `src/modules/workflows/**`, `src/modules/reports/**`, `src/modules/purchasing/**`, `src/identity/migrations.ts` (additive users.name) — backend only, NO `web/**` edits. Embedded Postgres via test harness (no fixed ports) |

## Rules

- Claim one queue item before editing code.
- Do not work an overlapping queue item while this file is `ACTIVE`.
- If a lock looks stale, mark it `STALE?` and stop for review; do not silently overwrite it.
- Release the lock only after commit and push succeed.
- If blocked, leave the lock active and write the blocker clearly.

## Common Multi-Agent Failure Modes

- One agent verifies against stale code while another has unpushed changes.
- Two agents edit the same tests or routes and one overwrites the other.
- A dev server, backend server, or Postgres instance from another session changes e2e results.
- One agent updates migrations while another tests an older schema.
- A second agent sees failures caused by a dirty tree, not by the application.
