# FinderPOS — Work State
> Last updated: 2026-07-03 21:10 CDT  |  Location: `WORK/` (canonical AI work folder — see `WORK/README.md`)

---

## Active task

**Phase 1: Truth and cleanup** per `WORK/FORWARD_PLAN.md`. Feature/module expansion is
**PAUSED** until Phase 2 (core release spine) exit criteria pass.

2026-07-03 session C (orchestration/test-runner follow-up — full findings in `WORK/AUDIT_2026-07-03C.md`):
orchestration runtime defect is now **Built and verified** at smoke level. Commit
`54c2c2e` added runtime state tables (`workflow_instances`, `workflow_instance_steps`,
`workflow_events`, `retry_state`, `workflow_locks`, `job_queue`), avoided the existing
business `workflow_steps` table collision, synchronized the command registry from the
actual `CommandBus`, registered the remaining command handlers, and added a smoke
assertion that fails if any workflow instance ends in `failed`. `npm run smoke` now has
14 steps and verifies "orchestration recorded no failed workflow instances." Follow-up
local change: `scripts/test.ts` now runs backend tests with `NODE_ENV=test` and
`FINDER_BACKGROUND_JOBS=false`, preventing orchestration job timers from keeping tests
pending after DB pool cleanup. Backend gate after this change: `npm run typecheck` PASS,
`npm run smoke` PASS, `npm test` PASS 311/311.

Frontend gate: `cd web && npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run build` PASS.
Lint still reports 4 pre-existing React hook warnings. `cd web && npm test` still FAILS
8 stale Vitest assertions (`web/tests/catalogCart.test.tsx` 5,
`web/tests/reportsDashboard.test.tsx` 3), matching the known queue item.

Coordination update: `WORK/LOCK.md` is now the required multi-agent claim file. Before
editing code, any AI agent must claim one queue item there, stop on overlapping active
claims, and release the lock only after commit + push. This prevents duplicate work,
dirty-tree overwrites, stale verification, server/port conflicts, and migration/test
failures caused by another active AI session.

2026-07-03 session B (deep verification — full findings in `WORK/AUDIT_2026-07-03B.md`):
live-stack proof DONE on local Postgres 15. Smoke 13/13 green (real POS lifecycle).
Endpoint probe: ~464/484 frontend-declared endpoints exist on the real backend.
**First-ever complete e2e run** (production build, mocks OFF, real backend):
**25 passed / 22 failed** — 10 core-flow failures (checkout/receive/invoice-pay/logout;
partly stale locators) + 12 vertical-page failures (some crash without mocks).
Agent instructions created (`AGENTS.md` repo + workspace; `WORK/RULES.md` = standing
policy). Cleanups: tracked `src/shared/db 2.ts` removed; **ALL agent worktrees removed**
(dirty states preserved as wip salvage commits; 12 salvage branches parked — harvest
inventory in AUDIT_2026-07-03B appendix; note: end-of-day Z-report and inventory
adjustment modal branches are Phase-2 relevant). `NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK` made env-overridable
(default still "true"). Stale e2e locators fixed (setup + login spec).

**Confirmed defects (priority order — each is one session's work item)**
1. **e2e core-flow failures (10/47)**: triage checkout ×3, inventory-receive ×3,
   invoice-pay ×3, logout ×1 — separate stale locators from real integration gaps; fix
   until core specs green against production build + real backend.
2. **8 stale vitest tests**: `web/tests/catalogCart.test.tsx` (5), `web/tests/reportsDashboard.test.tsx` (3).
3. **~14 mock-only endpoints** incl. core `POST /inventory/transfers`, `POST /inventory/adjustments`,
   `POST /team`, `GET /team/:id`, `GET /workflows/templates`, Vendor-360 family (6 routes).
4. **RLS gap**: `withTenant()` adopted in only ~10/46 modules; policy permissive when unset.
5. **Mock default flip decision**: deployed frontend is 100% mock; needs real-backend
   deployment target + staging DB before flipping `NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK` default.
6. **Vertical pages crash without mocks (12 e2e failures)** — deprioritized per RULES.md
   expansion pause; do not fix before items 1–6.

**Blockers:** none.

## Enterprise Domain Roadmap (reference — sequencing PAUSED per FORWARD_PLAN Phase 1)

> Full spec: [`docs/ENTERPRISE_DOMAIN_ROADMAP.md`](docs/ENTERPRISE_DOMAIN_ROADMAP.md)

**Design principle:** Build in **dependency order**, not feature order. Do not add isolated features — complete domain-by-domain so every module connects through a consistent data model, RBAC, audit logging, and shared business rules.

### Build sequence

| Priority | Domain | Path | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Sales & Order Management | `/sales` | 🔶 Partial — **next domain** |
| 2 | Customer 360 | `/customers/[id]` upgrade | 🔶 Partial |
| 3 | Supplier 360 | `/vendors/[id]` upgrade | 🔶 Partial |
| 4 | Warehouse Management (WMS) | `/warehouse` | 🔲 Not started |
| 5 | Pricing Engine | `/pricing` | 🔶 Embedded in Products |
| 6 | Promotion Engine | `/promotions` upgrade | 🔶 Basic page |
| 7 | Enterprise Workflow Engine | `/workflows` upgrade | 🔶 Basic page |
| 8 | Notification Center | `/notifications` upgrade | 🔶 Basic page |
| 9 | Document Center | `/documents` | 🔲 Not started |
| 10 | Business Intelligence | `/analytics` | 🔶 Basic dashboards |
| 11 | Automation Engine | `/automations` | 🔶 Basic page |
| 12 | Integration Hub | `/integrations` upgrade | 🔶 Basic page |
| 13 | Analytics & AI | `/ai-insights` | 🔶 Basic page |

### Order lifecycle (immutable — use status transitions only)
`Customer → Cart → Order → Payment → Invoice → Delivery → Return → Refund → Accounting`

### Order status state machine
`Draft → Confirmed → Processing → Packed → Shipped → Delivered → Completed | Returned | Cancelled | Backordered | On Hold`

---

## Enterprise Inventory Pipeline (authoritative)

> Full spec: [`docs/ENTERPRISE_INVENTORY_PIPELINE.md`](docs/ENTERPRISE_INVENTORY_PIPELINE.md)

### Pipeline status flow
`Suggested → Draft PO → Sent to Supplier → Confirmed → Partially Received → Fully Received → Supplier Billed → Cost Verified → Closed`

### Key design rules

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Never blind import** | Every EDI/CSV import runs 13 safeguard checks before touching inventory |
| **Price history always** | Every PO receive → insert into `supplier_product_price_history` |
| **Preferred supplier lock** | Never overwrite preferred supplier without explicit approval |
| **Duplicate = hard block** | Duplicate PO number or invoice number = blocked, not warned |
| **Large cost change → approval** | Threshold configurable per tenant; movement held until approved |
| **Reorder formula** | `(Avg Daily Sales × Lead Time) + Safety Stock − Available − Incoming` |
| **Supplier comparison** | Always surface cheapest recent price across all linked suppliers |

### 5 new schema tables
`supplier_product_price_history`, `reorder_suggestions`, `edi_imports`, `edi_import_errors`, `purchase_invoice_matches`

### 3 new pages needed
| Page | Path | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Inventory Pipeline | `/inventory/pipeline` | Not built |
| EDI Imports | `/purchasing/edi-imports` | Not built |
| Error Check Center | `/inventory/errors` | Not built |

---

## Enterprise Product Spec (authoritative)

> Full spec: [`docs/ENTERPRISE_PRODUCT_SPEC.md`](docs/ENTERPRISE_PRODUCT_SPEC.md)

Products are the **central business entity** — every other module references them. The product module is a PIM + Inventory + Supply Chain system, not a CRUD form.

### Key design rules

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| **360° workspace** | Product Detail = tabbed workspace (24 tabs), not a form. Left nav + center content + right KPI panel + sticky action bar |
| **Master → Variant split** | Master holds shared data (name, brand, images, SEO). Variant holds sellable data (SKU, barcode, price, inventory) |
| **Lifecycle state machine** | Draft → Pending Approval → Approved → Published → Selling → Low Stock → Reorder → Discontinued → Archived |
| **Tracking modes** | Per product: No/SKU/Barcode/Serial/Batch/Lot/RFID/IMEI/GTIN/Expiry tracking |
| **Warehouse granularity** | Warehouse → Zone → Aisle → Rack → Shelf → Bin → Pallet (per-location stock) |
| **List view modes** | Collapsed master / Expanded parent-child / Grid / Ecommerce / Inventory / Label |
| **Bulk safety** | Preview before apply, audit log per field, rollback, requires `products.bulk_update` permission |
| **Label printing** | Mixed-type queue, per-product-type templates, 15+ label sizes, USB/BT/Wi-Fi/ZPL/ESC/POS |

### New schema tables (label printing + ecommerce)
`ecommerce_product_settings`, `label_templates`, `product_label_settings`, `label_print_jobs`, `label_print_job_items`, `printers`, `printer_drivers`, `print_logs`

### New RBAC codes
`products.bulk_update`, `ecommerce_products.publish`, `labels.print`, `labels.manage_templates`, `printers.test`

---

## Enterprise UX Spec (authoritative)

> Full spec: [`docs/ENTERPRISE_UX_SPEC.md`](docs/ENTERPRISE_UX_SPEC.md)

### UX rules that apply on every new page/component

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Permission-gated nav** | Hide sidebar items if user lacks `[module].view` |
| **Permission-gated buttons** | Wrap all create/edit/delete/approve in `<Can permission="...">` |
| **Page header standard** | Title + description + breadcrumb + gated import/export/create buttons |
| **Detail page tabs** | Use tab pattern from spec §4 (Product, Customer, Outlet, User, Role) |
| **Table requirements** | Search + filters + pagination + bulk actions + export + empty/loading/error states |
| **Form requirements** | Sections + required indicators + inline validation + unsaved-changes guard |
| **Confirmation modal** | Required for: refund, void, delete, archive, disable user, revoke sessions, receive inventory, change permissions |
| **Offline UX** | Terminal shows online/offline badge, last-sync time, pending queue count |
| **Page connections** | Dashboard → detail pages; Orders → Customer; PO → Vendor; etc. Always wire `href` links |
| **RBAC components** | `Can`, `CanAny`, `CanAll`, `PermissionGuard`, `RoleGuard`, `OutletAccessGuard`, `ReadOnlyWrapper` |

---

## Enterprise Architecture (authoritative)

> Full spec: [`docs/ENTERPRISE_ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ENTERPRISE_ARCHITECTURE.md)

### Non-negotiable design rules
| Rule | Description |
|---|---|
| **Multi-tenant first** | Every business-owned table must have `tenant_id UUID NOT NULL`. Never query without tenant filter. |
| **Inventory ledger** | Every stock change creates an `inventory_movements` record. No simple qty updates. |
| **Immutable financials** | Orders, payments, refunds: use status changes + adjustment records. Never silent edits. |
| **Offline-first POS** | IndexedDB, sync queue, idempotency keys, device IDs, conflict resolution. |
| **Event-driven** | Key actions emit events (`order.created`, `payment.completed`, `inventory.decreased`, etc.). |

### Schema table inventory (30 tables defined)

| Domain | Tables |
|---|---|
| Identity & Access | `tenants`, `tenant_settings`, `users`, `roles`, `permissions`, `role_permissions`, `user_roles`, `user_sessions` |
| Organization | `outlets`, `registers`, `cash_drawer_sessions` |
| Catalog | `categories`, `brands`, `products`, `product_variants`, `price_books`, `price_book_items` |
| Inventory Ledger | `inventory_balances`, `inventory_movements`, `stock_transfers`, `stock_transfer_items` |
| Customers | `customer_groups`, `customers` |
| Sales | `orders`, `order_items`, `payment_methods`, `payments`, `refunds` |
| Returns | `returns`, `return_items` |
| Purchasing | `vendors`, `vendor_products`, `purchase_orders`, `purchase_order_items` |
| Taxes/Promos | `tax_rates`, `discounts`, `gift_cards`, `gift_card_transactions` |
| Platform | `audit_logs`, `devices`, `sync_events`, `webhooks`, `webhook_deliveries`, `daily_sales_summary` |

### Build phases
| Phase | Status | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Foundation | 🔶 Frontend built, backend mock | tenants, users, roles, outlets, registers, auth, audit_logs |
| 2 — Catalog & Inventory | 🔶 Frontend built, backend mock | products, variants, inventory_balances, inventory_movements |
| 3 — POS Sales | 🔶 Frontend built, backend mock | orders, order_items, payments, tax, discounts |
| 4 — Customers & Loyalty | 🔶 Frontend built, backend mock | customers, customer_groups, gift_cards, loyalty_points |
| 5 — Purchasing | 🔶 Frontend built, backend mock | vendors, purchase_orders, receiving, cost updates |
| 6 — Enterprise Layer | 🔲 Partial frontend | sync_events, devices, webhooks, reports, approval workflows |
| 7 — Scale Layer | 🔲 Not started | Read replicas, queues, analytics warehouse, search, ERP sync |

### Key architecture decisions
- **Stack**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript (frontend) · Express + TypeScript + PostgreSQL (backend, in `src/`)
- **ORM target**: Prisma or Drizzle (currently raw SQL in backend)
- **Auth**: JWT access tokens + refresh token rotation · Argon2 password hashing · MFA for owners
- **Money**: Always integer cents in DB and API, never floats · `formatMoney(cents)` on display
- **Inventory movements**: Every balance change must reference a movement type: `SALE`, `RETURN`, `PURCHASE_RECEIVE`, `TRANSFER_IN/OUT`, `ADJUSTMENT_IN/OUT`, `DAMAGE`, `LOSS`, `COUNT_CORRECTION`
- **Permissions**: 28 granular permission codes across 8 domains (see full spec)

---

## Mock handler coverage

All API routes for built modules have MSW handlers in `web/mocks/mockHandlers.ts`.

Key patterns:
- `V1 = "*/api/v1"` wildcard prefix
- `await lat()` first line in every handler
- IIFE spread pattern: `...(() => { let state; return [...handlers]; })(),`
- Sub-paths registered BEFORE `/:id` to avoid wrong matching

---

## Known bad redirects (quick fixes)

| Route | Currently redirects to | Should redirect to |
|---|---|---|
| `/inventory/returns` | `/vendors` | `/returns` |
| `/setup/loyalty` | `/settings` | `/loyalty` |

---

## Context cliff notes

- Pages: `web/app/(protected)/[module]/page.tsx`
- Mock handlers: `web/mocks/mockHandlers.ts` (NOT lightspeedHandlers.ts)
- Types: `web/api-client/types.ts`
- API client: `web/api-client/client.ts` → `apiGet / apiPost / apiPatch / apiDelete`
- Nav shell: `web/components/EnterpriseShell.tsx` — 3 places to update per new nav item
- Money: `formatMoney(cents)` from `@/lib/money`
- Catalog products in mock: `prod_1`–`prod_8`
- Settings page covers: taxes, payment modes, loyalty tiers, shipping, security, COA, receipts, API keys

---

## Next targets (priority order for launch)

1. **Golf vertical** ✅ DONE — 4 pages + nav wired; `module: "golf"` → `module: "tee_sheet"` fixed
2. **FE-R4: Restaurant Dashboard** ✅ DONE — `/restaurant/dashboard` with KPIs, hourly chart, top items, active sessions (2026-07-01)
3. **UX-2: Module marketplace** ✅ DONE — `/setup/modules` page already complete
4. **UX-3: Vertical dashboard widgets** ✅ DONE — `VerticalWidgets.tsx` already complete
5. **Split oversized pages** — reports/page.tsx ✅ DONE (866→246 ln); next: customers/page.tsx (810 ln), dashboard (803 ln), discounts (765 ln)
6. **Settings page split** ✅ DONE — CoaSection, DepositsSection, LoyaltyTiersSection extracted (2026-07-01)

## Enterprise Guardian — Last Audit

> Run: 2026-06-30 (post customers/[id] split)  |  Score: 94/100  |  Status: ✅ LAUNCH-READY (≥88, zero CRITICAL)
> Prior score: 93/100 → +1 pt (customers/[id] split 1705→441 ln, 9 extracted _components files, zero TS errors)

### Domain Scores

| Domain | Score | Grade | Top Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| TypeScript strictness | 100/100 | ✅ | Zero `error TS`, zero unguarded `any` in production code |
| Security | 98/100 | ✅ | Zero secrets, no XSS, no dangerouslySetInnerHTML |
| API contract | 92/100 | ✅ | All FE-51/FE-52 handlers correct; `await lat()` on all |
| Component quality | 88/100 | ✅ | customers/[id] split (1705→441 ln); catalog (1498) next |
| Accessibility | 95/100 | ✅ | `role="alert"` on all errors; icon buttons labeled |
| Performance | 89/100 | ✅ | 2 page splits done; catalog (1498), inventory (1229), purchasing still >800 ln |
| Design system | 86/100 | ✅ | `web/lib/date.ts` created; 5 import sites fixed; formatMoney + border-slate-200 done |
| Nav/routing | 97/100 | ✅ | All stubs verified valid; no bad redirects remaining |

### CRITICAL (blocks launch — fix first)

_None. TypeScript clean, security clean, all stubs point to real files._

### HIGH (degrading enterprise readiness)

_None._

### MEDIUM (tech debt — fix before v2)

- [x] **Design system — local date helpers** — ✅ DONE: `web/lib/date.ts` created with `fmtDate`, `fmtDateShort`, `fmtDateTime`, `fmtTime`; 5 import sites fixed (payments, appointments, imports-exports, inventory/counts, inventory/serials). Remaining pages (insights, ecommerce, purchasing, quotes, workforce) still have local definitions — audit these next.

- [x] **Design system — date helpers migration** — ✅ DONE: all 44 raw `new Date(x).toLocale*()` calls across 26 files replaced with `fmtDate`/`fmtTime`/`fmtDateTime` from `@/lib/date`. 3 custom-format sites kept intentionally (weekday header, 2-digit year, appointment picker). Zero TS errors. Commit `46e1a89`.

- [ ] **Design system — money in form inputs** — `(cents / 100).toFixed(2)` used to seed edit-form inputs in `catalog/page.tsx` (ln 94, 98, 99, 843–845), `customers/[id]/page.tsx` (ln 680, 699), `accounting/page.tsx` (ln 336). Correct for edit inputs (need dollar string), but comment-document why to avoid false audit flags.

- [ ] **Page size — split required** — pages exceeding 800-line threshold:
  - `settings/page.tsx` — ✅ DONE: 1818→644 ln (CoaSection, DepositsSection, LoyaltyTiersSection extracted)
  - `customers/[id]/page.tsx` — ✅ DONE: 1705→441 ln, 9 files in `customers/[id]/_components/`
  - `reports/page.tsx` — ✅ DONE: 866→246 ln (4 section files + reportHelpers.tsx)
  - `customers/page.tsx` — 810 ln — next split candidate
  - `dashboard/page.tsx` — 803 ln — next split candidate

### LOW (polish — backlog)

- [ ] `web/lib/offlineOutbox.ts` — IDB typing `(req.result as T[]).sort((a: any, b: any)...)` — use `IDBRequest<T[]>`.
- [ ] `web/lib/offlineOutbox.ts:176` — `(registration as any).sync.register(...)` — add ambient `BackgroundSyncManager` type.
- [ ] 9 stub pages report "no loading state" — these are pure re-exports with zero async work; false positive for that check. No action needed.

### Next session must-do (Claude's priority queue)

Score: 94/100 — launch-ready, zero CRITICAL.

#### Catalog detail page — DONE (2026-07-01)

| # | What | Status |

| 2 | Richer expiry (`/catalog/:id/expiry`) | ✅ DONE — ExpiryTab rewritten: 4-tier status, lot_code, location, notes, pre-computed days |
| 3 | Compliance endpoint (`PATCH /catalog/:id/compliance`) | ✅ DONE — already wired in MarketingTab |
| 4 | Hidden fields (tags, dims, ecommerce, vendor_upc) | ✅ DONE — all present in GeneralTab/InventoryTab |
| 5 | Live margin calculator | ✅ DONE — already in GeneralTab price table |
| 6 | Tab badges (expiry alert count) | ✅ DONE — red pill on Expiry tab when expired/critical batches |
| 7 | Margin + price on product header | ✅ DONE — price pill + colour-coded margin % in header |
| 8 | Barcode test button | ✅ DONE — in Actions menu, 3s inline pass/fail result |

#### Page splits still pending
- `customers/page.tsx` — 810 ln — extract filter bar, table, customer detail drawer
- `dashboard/page.tsx` — 803 ln — extract KPI section, top products, payment breakdown
- `discounts/page.tsx` — 765 ln — extract discount form, promotions section

**Done this session (2026-07-01, page splits):**
- workflows, terminal, quotes, operations, workforce, receive-stock, insights all split (7 pages)
- insights: 515→55 ln; ScheduledReportsTab + ForecastingTab + insightsTypes extracted; commit `aba0197`

**Done this session (2026-07-01, continued):**
- Date migration: 44 raw `toLocale*()` calls across 26 files → `fmtDate`/`fmtTime`/`fmtDateTime`; 3 custom formats intentionally kept; zero TS errors; commit `46e1a89`

**Done this session (2026-07-01):**
- Settings page split: CoaSection + DepositsSection + LoyaltyTiersSection → `_components/` (1003→644 ln)
- FE-R4 Restaurant Dashboard: `/restaurant/dashboard` — covers, avg ticket, table turns, peak hour, hourly revenue chart, top items, active sessions
- reports/page.tsx split: 4 sections → `_components/` (866→246 ln); shared helpers in reportHelpers.tsx
- catalog/[id]/page.tsx restructured: 3-tab editor (General | Inventory | Marketing) — 763→136 ln; GeneralTab (price table w/ markup/margin), InventoryTab (supplier, replenish, variants), MarketingTab (loyalty, compliance)

### SECURITY

#### ✅ PASSING

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Auth guard (frontend)** | `middleware.ts` checks `finder_session_hint` cookie on every protected route; redirects to `/login?next=<path>` if absent |
| **Auth guard (React)** | `(protected)/layout.tsx` reads `useAuth().status`; renders null + redirects on `"unauthenticated"` — double layer |
| **JWT verification (backend)** | `gateway/auth.ts` — `jsonwebtoken.verify()` on every request; rejects missing or invalid Bearer tokens with HTTP 401 |
| **httpOnly refresh token** | `finder_refresh` cookie is httpOnly (JS-unreadable); `finder_session_hint` is non-httpOnly hint only — actual auth secret never exposed to JS |
| **Token refresh race protection** | `_refreshPromise` singleton in `api-client/client.ts` prevents concurrent refreshes (lines 40, 90–95) |
| **Rate limiting** | `src/gateway/rateLimit.ts` — IP-based token-bucket (60 req burst / 20 RPS sustained); Redis-backed in prod (Lua atomic script prevents TOCTOU); per-tenant tiered limiter (standard/premium/enterprise) |
| **CORS** | Allowlist-based; defaults to `finder-pos.vercel.app` + `finder-pos-web.vercel.app` in prod; configurable via `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var; dev-only wildcard |
| **Security headers (frontend)** | `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, `Permissions-Policy` (camera/mic/geo disabled) |
| **CSP** | Restrictive in prod: `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'`; `connect-src` limited to self + `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`; `frame-ancestors 'none'` |
| **SQL injection** | All queries use `@named` / `?` placeholder compilation (`src/shared/db.ts` `compile()`); no raw string interpolation found in service layer |
| **Tenant isolation** | `db.withTenant(tenantId)` sets Postgres `app.tenant_id` config per transaction; RLS policies enforce at DB layer; every query in `custom_roles/service.ts` scopes to `tenant_id` |
| **Parameterized secrets check** | No hardcoded API keys, tokens, or passwords found in `web/app/` source code |
| **Helmet (backend)** | `helmet` imported and applied in `src/app.ts` — adds baseline HTTP security headers on backend |
| **No XSS via React** | Zero `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in any page component; React escapes all interpolated values |
| **Offline outbox** | IndexedDB (not localStorage); carries idempotency key on every queued checkout for safe replay |
| **SSE notifications** | `useNotifications()` uses `EventSource` (not polling); per-tenant broker in `src/shared/sse.ts`; 25s heartbeat keeps proxies alive; cleanup on `close`/`error` |
| **gitignore** | `.env`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `.vercel`, `*.db` all ignored |
| **No competitor brand names** | Zero references found in source tree |

#### 🔴 CRITICAL — Must Fix Before Production

| ID | File | Issue | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SEC-1** | `.env` (repo root) | A `VERCEL_TOKEN` is stored in `.env` which IS in `.gitignore` but the file EXISTS on disk. If the repo is ever archived, zipped, or deployed via `git archive`, this token leaks. **Rotate this token immediately via the Vercel dashboard.** | Token compromise → unauthorized deploys |
| **SEC-2** | `web/middleware.ts:54` | CSP uses `'unsafe-eval'` in development. If the dev build is ever accidentally deployed to staging/prod (e.g., via `NODE_ENV` misconfiguration), eval-based XSS becomes possible. Should be `NODE_ENV === "production"` guard verified at deploy time, not runtime. | XSS if wrong build deployed |
| **SEC-3** | `web/middleware.ts` | **Missing `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS) header.** The middleware sets `X-Frame-Options`, `CSP`, etc., but no HSTS. Without it, browsers may downgrade to HTTP on first load before the cookie is set. Add: `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` | HTTPS downgrade on first visit |

---

#### 🟠 HIGH — Fix Before Launch

| ID | File | Issue | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SEC-4** | `web/app/(protected)/catalog/_components/PrintLabelsModal.tsx:9` | Uses `win.document.write()` to inject product `name`, `sku`, `barcode` values into a popup window without escaping. If any product field contains `</script>` or `<img onerror=…>`, it executes in the popup context. Mitigation: use `textContent` assignment or sanitize all fields before injection. | Stored XSS via product data |
| **SEC-5** | `web/middleware.ts` | `middleware.ts` allows `/api` path prefix through without auth check (line: `"/api"` in `PUBLIC_PATH_PREFIXES`). This is correct for MSW in dev, but means all Next.js API routes (`/api/*`) are publicly accessible. If any server-side API routes are added under `web/app/api/`, they must implement their own auth. Currently no real API routes exist there, but this is a silent footgun. | Future API routes exposed |
| **SEC-6** | `src/app.ts` | CORS uses `isDev = process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production"` — any non-production NODE_ENV value (e.g., `"staging"`, `"test"`) opens CORS to all origins. Should be `isDev = process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"` for safety. | CORS bypass in staging |

---

#### 🟡 MEDIUM — Tech Debt

| ID | Issue |
|---|---|
| **SEC-7** | No `SameSite=Strict` or `SameSite=Lax` attribute documented for `finder_refresh` cookie. CSRF risk if backend ever adds state-mutating GET endpoints. |
| **SEC-8** | `imports-exports/page.tsx:116` attaches `Authorization: Bearer <token>` via a direct `fetch()` call outside `apiFetch` — bypasses the 401-refresh retry logic. If token expires mid-upload, the request fails silently with no refresh. |
| **SEC-9** | Rate limiter uses `Math.floor(Date.now() / windowMs)` for Redis fixed-window. This means all clients reset simultaneously at window boundaries — a "thundering herd" burst is possible. Upgrade to sliding window for sensitive endpoints (login, password reset). |
| **SEC-10** | Password reset and signup pages have no client-side rate limiting UI feedback. Backend rate limits, but UX shows no "too many attempts" state — users retry excessively. |

### BUGS

#### 🔴 CONFIRMED BUGS

| ID | File | Bug | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| **BUG-1** | `web/mocks/mockHandlers.ts:4244 + 5517` | **Duplicate `customer-invoices` handlers** — `GET /customer-invoices`, `GET /customer-invoices/:id`, `POST /customer-invoices`, `PATCH /customer-invoices/:id/status`, `GET /customer-invoices/lookup-upc` all registered **twice** (10 duplicate registrations total). MSW matches the FIRST handler; the second block (lines 5517–5587) is dead code. The second block may have different seed data — silently wrong data if someone edits it thinking it's live. | Wrong/stale mock data; confusing to maintain |
| **BUG-2** | `web/app/(protected)/warehouse/page.tsx` | All 6 tab data-fetch calls (`apiGet(...).then(...)`) have **no `.catch()`**. If any endpoint returns an error, the `loading` state stays `true` forever — the tab shows infinite skeleton. Pages freeze with no user-visible error. | Infinite loading on API failure |
| **BUG-3** | `web/app/(protected)/pricing/page.tsx` | Same as BUG-2 — all 5 tab fetches (`PriceBooksTab`, `TierPricingTab`, etc.) use `.then()` with no `.catch()`. Error state `setError` is defined in some tabs (`ContractPricesTab`) but not all. `PriceBooksTab` and `TierPricingTab` have no error state at all — failures silently set `loading=false` with empty data. | Silent empty UI on error |
| **BUG-4** | `web/app/(protected)/inventory/transfers/page.tsx` | **1-line stub** — `export { default } from "../../operations/page"`. The `/inventory/transfers` route renders the full Operations page, not a transfers page. Users navigating to "Transfers" from inventory sub-nav land on the wrong page. | Confusing UX — wrong page shown |
| **BUG-5** | `web/mocks/mockHandlers.ts` | `GET /orders` handler filters by status but the seed orders (`ord_s_1`–`ord_s_6`) are defined inside the IIFE that also creates `termOrders`. If the orders page filter is used before the IIFE runs (race), 0 orders return. In practice no race, but the handler at line 3851 filters `termOrders` which may not include the 6 seed orders if they were added to a different array. Needs cross-check. | Potential empty orders list |
| **BUG-6** | Multiple stub pages (see list below) | **36 pages are 1-line re-exports** pointing to other modules. Some are intentional (setup/* → settings), but others (finance/bills, finance/payment-made, ecommerce/customers, ecommerce/orders, etc.) render the wrong parent page. Users who bookmark or navigate directly to these URLs see unexpected content. | Confusing UX; SEO/link confusion |

**Stub pages that render wrong content (not intentional aliases):**
`/inventory/count` → operations, `/finance/bills` → finance, `/finance/payment-made` → finance, `/finance/settings` → finance, `/ecommerce/customers` → ecommerce, `/ecommerce/products` → ecommerce, `/ecommerce/shipping` → ecommerce, `/ecommerce/promotions` → ecommerce, `/ecommerce/orders` → ecommerce, `/ecommerce/categories` → ecommerce, `/catalog/gift-cards` → gift-cards, `/catalog/products` → catalog, `/catalog/suppliers` → vendors

---

#### 🟡 MEDIUM BUGS

| ID | File | Bug |
|---|---|---|
| **BUG-7** | `web/app/(protected)/customers/[id]/_components/OrdersTab.tsx:42` | Fetches `GET /orders?limit=200` and client-filters by `customerId`. If a customer has >200 orders, earlier ones are silently dropped. No pagination or "showing N of M" indicator. |
| **BUG-8** | `web/app/(protected)/pricing/page.tsx` (SimulatorTab) | `SimulatorTab` `runSim()` is not wrapped in try/catch. If the API call fails, `loading` stays `true` and the button shows "Resolving…" indefinitely. |
| **BUG-9** | `web/lib/offlineOutbox.ts` | IDB sort uses `(req.result as T[]).sort((a: any, b: any) => ...)` — `any` cast bypasses type safety. If IDB returns non-array (corrupt store), this throws uncaught runtime error. |
| **BUG-10** | `web/lib/offlineOutbox.ts:176` | `(registration as any).sync.register("checkout-replay")` — Background Sync API is typed `as any`, so TypeScript won't catch breaking changes. Also: no fallback check whether Background Sync is actually supported before calling. |

### API ENDPOINT COVERAGE

#### Summary
- **Total mock handlers:** 465 routes across `mockHandlers.ts` (7,475 lines)
- **All routes use `await lat()`** — simulated latency on every handler ✅
- **`/api` prefix passthrough** — all real API calls go to `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`; MSW intercepts `*/api/v1/*` in dev/test ✅

### FIREWALLS & NETWORK SECURITY

| Layer | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **Frontend middleware** | ✅ | Next.js middleware guards all non-`/api` routes; redirects unauthenticated → `/login` |
| **Backend JWT gate** | ✅ | `makeAuthMiddleware()` runs before every route in `src/app.ts`; 401 on invalid/missing token |
| **IP rate limiter** | ✅ | 60 burst / 20 RPS per IP; Redis-backed in prod (atomic Lua); in-memory fallback in dev |
| **Tenant rate limiter** | ✅ | Per-tenant tiered limits (standard/premium/enterprise); runs after auth so tenantId is known |
| **CORS allowlist** | ✅ | Hardcoded Vercel origins in prod; `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env override; dev-only wildcard |
| **CSP** | ⚠️ | `unsafe-inline` for scripts/styles (required by Next.js without nonce); `unsafe-eval` in dev (SEC-2) |
| **HSTS** | 🔴 | **Missing** — no `Strict-Transport-Security` header in frontend middleware (SEC-3) |
| **XFF IP spoofing** | ✅ | `extractClientIp()` uses rightmost-N strategy based on `TRUST_PROXY_DEPTH`; prevents spoofed `X-Forwarded-For` bypassing rate limits |
| **Helmet** | ✅ | Applied in backend Express app — `X-Powered-By` removed, HSTS set for HTTPS responses |
| **Clickjacking** | ✅ | `X-Frame-Options: DENY` + `frame-ancestors 'none'` in CSP |
| **MIME sniffing** | ✅ | `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` |
| **Permissions policy** | ✅ | Camera, microphone, geolocation disabled; payment limited to self |

### FALLBACKS & SAFEGUARDS

| Area | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **Offline checkout** | ✅ | `offlineOutbox.ts` — IndexedDB queue, idempotency keys, Background Sync replay, manual retry fallback |
| **Token refresh** | ✅ | `apiFetch` retries once after 401 via `silentRefresh()`; clears session + redirects on failure |
| **Loading skeletons** | ✅ | All major pages show skeleton loaders (`animate-pulse`) during fetch |
| **Error state display** | ⚠️ | `/warehouse` and `/pricing` tab components have no `.catch()` — freeze on error (BUG-2, BUG-3) |
| **Empty states** | ✅ | All tables have explicit empty-state messages |
| **Confirmation modals** | ✅ | Void, refund, delete, archive all require confirm modal with explicit warning copy |
| **`safeLoad()` wrapper** | ✅ | `api-client/client.ts` — catches unhandled rejections; used in settings, catalog, customers |
| **Environment variable fail-fast** | ✅ | `buildApp()` throws on missing `JWT_SECRET` / `DATABASE_URL` in production before serving |
| **Redis fail-open** | ✅ | Rate limiter Redis path catches errors and calls `next()` — Redis outage doesn't block traffic |
| **SSE reconnect** | ⚠️ | `useNotifications.ts` uses `EventSource` which auto-reconnects; however, there is no max-retry or exponential backoff — on network partition it retries indefinitely at browser default interval (~3s), potentially flooding the server |
| **DB connection pooling** | ✅ | `pg.Pool` with `poolStats()` health check; transactions scoped with `withTenant()` and `withRequestId()` |
| **BIGINT parse** | ✅ | `types.setTypeParser(20, ...)` prevents silent precision loss on int8 values |
| **Order immutability** | ✅ | Orders use status transitions + `order_events` timeline; no in-place edits |
| **Inventory ledger** | ✅ | Every stock change must create an `inventory_movements` record (enforced in architecture spec) |
| **Audit log** | ✅ | `/audit-log` page wired; `audit_logs` table in schema |

---

### NOTIFICATIONS

| Feature | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **Delivery mechanism** | ✅ SSE | `useNotifications()` opens `EventSource('/api/v1/stream')`; real-time push from backend |
| **Backend broker** | ✅ | `SseBroker` in `src/shared/sse.ts`; per-tenant fan-out; 25s heartbeat; cleanup on disconnect |
| **Redis pub/sub** | ✅ | Cross-instance fan-out via `finder:events` Redis channel (multi-replica safe) |
| **Notification bell** | ✅ | `NotificationBell.tsx`; unread count badge; mark-all-read; dismiss per item |
| **Notification page** | ✅ | `/notifications` — full list, filter (all/unread), severity badges (info/warning/critical) |
| **Event types handled** | ✅ | `order_created`, `payment_captured`, `low_stock`, `tier_upgraded` |
| **Missing event types** | ⚠️ | No handlers for: `sync_error`, `purchase_order_received`, `new_order`, `order_fulfilled`, `payment_failed` — these exist in `NotificationType` enum but `buildNotification()` returns `null` (drops them silently) |
| **In-app toast** | ⚠️ | No toast/snackbar system — notifications only appear in the bell dropdown; high-priority alerts (payment failed, low stock critical) have no immediate visual pop |
| **Email/SMS** | ⚠️ | Architecture specifies email/SMS/push channels; only in-app is wired; `SENDGRID_API_KEY` warned-but-optional in `buildApp()` |
| **Notification preferences** | ✅ | `/notifications` page has channel preference UI (per-type toggles) |
| **SSE reconnect gap** | ⚠️ | If SSE connection drops, notifications between disconnect and reconnect are lost (no catch-up query on reconnect) — should `GET /notifications?since=<lastTs>` on reconnect |
