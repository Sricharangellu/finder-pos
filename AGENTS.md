# FinderPOS — Agent Instructions

Read this first. It applies to EVERY agent, workflow, and AI session working in this repo
(Claude Code, subagents, background agents, any other tool).

## The one rule that overrides everything

All AI process output — work state, plans, audits, reports, matrices, handoffs — goes in
**`WORK/`** and nowhere else. Update files in place; override only if required (read the
target first, reconcile, don't clobber). Never create `FILE 2.md`, `_v2`, `_FINAL`, or
dated copies of living docs. Full rules: `WORK/README.md`.

## Session start (in order, ~2 minutes)

1. `WORK/README.md` — folder rules
2. `WORK/RULES.md` — build rules, definition of done, per-task prompt, readiness matrix
3. `WORK/WORK_STATE.md` — active task, next actions, blockers
4. `WORK/FORWARD_PLAN.md` — phase plan and release gates
5. Newest `WORK/AUDIT_*.md` — last verified truth

Do not cold-read the whole repo; the context you need is in those four files.

## Current marching orders

Feature/module/page expansion is **PAUSED**. Work the phase plan in
`WORK/FORWARD_PLAN.md`: verify truth → harden the core retail spine → production
hardening → only then expand. One work item per session, verified before commit.

**Queued major initiative:** `WORK/FOUNDATION_HARDENING.md` — a whole-repo cleanup +
governance-consolidation + end-to-end-wiring pass. It must run as a **single exclusive
lock claim when the board is otherwise clear** (it touches the whole tree). Do not start
it piecemeal alongside other active claims.

## Multi-agent coordination lock

Before editing code, check `WORK/LOCK.md`.

**Agent teams** (experimental, enabled in Sri's user settings): a session may spawn
in-session teammates with a shared task list. The whole team is ONE lock unit — the
lead claims one queue item in `WORK/LOCK.md` listing the union of files its teammates
will touch, splits the work so no two teammates edit the same file, and releases the
claim after the combined result is verified, committed, and pushed. Teammates never
claim lock entries themselves, and inter-team coordination with other app sessions
(desktop Claude, Codex, etc.) still happens only through this lock file.

- If it is marked `FREE`, claim exactly one queue item by editing `WORK/LOCK.md` with:
  agent/session name, queue item, files/areas expected, start time, and status `ACTIVE`.
- If it is `ACTIVE` and the item overlaps your intended work, **stop**. Do not build the
  same fix in parallel. Pull latest, read the active claim, and either wait or pick a
  non-overlapping queue item only if `WORK/WORK_STATE.md` allows it.
- If it is `ACTIVE` but clearly stale, do not delete it silently. Mark it `STALE?` in
  `WORK/LOCK.md`, add a note to `WORK/WORK_STATE.md`, and stop for human/lead review.
- At handoff, update `WORK/LOCK.md` back to `FREE` only after commit + push succeeds and
  `WORK/WORK_STATE.md` records what changed. If blocked, leave the lock `ACTIVE` with
  blocker details so another agent does not duplicate the same broken path.

Parallel AI sessions can create false errors: stale builds, port conflicts, dirty-tree
overwrites, duplicate fixes, migration mismatches, and e2e failures caused by another
server/process. Treat unexplained failures as possible coordination conflicts until
`git status`, `git pull --ff-only`, ports, and `WORK/LOCK.md` are checked.

## Verification commands (run before claiming anything works)

```bash
npm run typecheck          # backend, from repo root
npm test                   # backend suite (unit-level, stubbed DB)
npm run smoke              # REAL end-to-end proof: boots app on real Postgres
cd web && npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test && npm run build
```

`npm run smoke` is the strongest single check — it drives the full POS lifecycle
(auth → catalog → inventory → order → payment → offline sync → refund) over HTTP
against a real database. Watch its stderr: workflow/orchestration errors in the log
are real defects even when the steps pass.

## Honest status labels (required in all docs and reports)

`Built and verified` · `Built but not verified` · `UI-only` · `Mocked` · `Partial` ·
`Planned` · `Not production-ready`. Never call something done without one of these.

## Git: where and how (trunk-based, staged toward PR gating)

- **Remote:** `origin` = https://github.com/Sricharangellu/finder-pos.git · **trunk:** `master`
  (protected: force-pushes and deletion are blocked). `staging` exists for preview deploys.
- **Session start:** `git pull --ff-only origin master`. If it refuses, stop and reconcile —
  never rebase/force-push master.
- **Commits:** conventional commits (`feat:`/`fix:`/`chore:`/`docs:`/`ci:`/`test:`), small
  and scoped, one logical change each. Never commit secrets or generated artifacts.
- **Gates before any push/PR:** `npm run typecheck && npm test` (root), `npm run smoke`
  for backend changes, `cd web && npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test && npm run build`.
  Never leave unpushed work on one machine at handoff.

### Current mode (Phase 1): direct-to-master

Solo owner + coordinated AI sessions push directly to `master` after the gates and the
`WORK/LOCK.md` claim protocol. CI runs on every push and is the regression net.

### Target mode (company-standard, switch when Sri enables PR protection)

Short-lived feature branches + pull requests, exactly how professional teams run trunk-based
development:

1. `git switch -c <type>/<scope>-<slug>` (e.g. `fix/e2e-checkout-locators`) from fresh master.
2. Commit, push the branch, open a PR: `gh pr create --fill` (template auto-applies;
   fill the RULES.md status label and gate results honestly).
3. CI must be green; enable auto-merge: `gh pr merge --auto --squash --delete-branch`.
4. Squash-merge keeps master history one-commit-per-change; branch auto-deletes.

The cutover is a GitHub settings change (require PRs + required status checks on master) —
listed under "Sri-only actions" below. The day that's enabled, direct pushes stop working
and every agent follows the PR flow above; nothing else about the process changes.

### Sri-only actions (agents cannot do these)

- Flip master to PR-required: Settings → Branches → master rule → "Require a pull request
  before merging" + "Require status checks" (select: Backend, Frontend, Production guard,
  E2E) — or ask an agent for the exact `gh api` command when ready.
- Repo Settings → General: enable "Allow squash merging" only + "Automatically delete
  head branches".
- Fix Actions secrets: `VERCEL_TOKEN` (production deploy fails today), `STAGING_BACKEND_URL`,
  staging DB secrets.

### Branch hygiene

- **Salvage branches:** 12 `worktree-agent-*` branches on origin are parked pre-pause work —
  do NOT delete or bulk-merge; harvest selectively per `WORK/AUDIT_2026-07-03B.md` through
  the RULES.md definition of done.
- Stale merged branches (`dev`, `prod`, `testing`, `backend-cycle3`) are deletion candidates
  pending Sri's confirmation.
- If you create a branch or worktree, delete it when merged / before ending the session.

## Repo hygiene & single source of truth (enforced — do not defeat)

Duplicate files and second checkouts caused real damage (blocked rebases, diverged
trees, lost-then-recovered work). These rules exist so it cannot recur:

- **One agent file:** this `AGENTS.md`. `CLAUDE.md` is only a short pointer to it (Claude
  Code auto-reads CLAUDE.md). Do not create a second agent-instruction file. CI fails the
  build if more than one `AGENTS.md` is tracked.
- **One plan:** `WORK/FORWARD_PLAN.md` is the single plan (commands, rules, phase queue).
  `WORK/WORK_STATE.md` is live state, `WORK/LOCK.md` is the claim board. Do not fork these.
- **Never create ` 2.<ext>` copies or `*.collision-backup.md`.** They are `.gitignore`d and
  a CI guard fails if one is force-committed. If a save/export/merge flow spits one out,
  delete it — never commit it, never `git add -f` it. If two sessions need the same dated
  audit, the second uses the next letter (`…G.md` → `…H.md`), never a duplicate name.
- **One canonical checkout.** Work only in the primary clone. Do NOT make a second clone
  (e.g. `finder-pos-github`) — two clones of the same remote diverge and collide on push.
  For parallel sessions use `git worktree add ../wt-<task>` (isolated working dirs sharing
  one repo) — never independent clones. Confirm your cwd is the canonical checkout before
  editing.
- Before ending a session: `git status` must show no untracked ` 2.` / backup junk.

## Local runbook (macOS dev machine)

- **Fast proof (no setup):** `npm run smoke` — boots the real app on embedded Postgres and
  drives the full POS lifecycle. Local Postgres 15 also available:
  `export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@15/bin:$PATH"`.
- **Real-stack e2e** (mocks OFF requires a PRODUCTION build — `npm run dev` ALWAYS mocks,
  never use the dev server to verify real-backend behavior):
  1. `pg_ctl -D /opt/homebrew/var/postgresql@15 start && createdb finder_e2e`
  2. Backend: `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://$USER@localhost:5432/finder_e2e JWT_SECRET=<any> PORT=3001 npx tsx src/server.ts` (migrations run at boot)
  3. Seed: same `DATABASE_URL` + `npx tsx scripts/seed-e2e.ts` → login `owner@finder-pos.dev` / `FinderDemo!2026`
  4. Frontend: `cd web && NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK=false npm run build && cp -r .next/static .next/standalone/.next/static && cp -r public .next/standalone/public && PORT=3000 BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001 node .next/standalone/server.js`
  5. `cd web && npx playwright test` (baseline 2026-07-03: 25 passed / 22 failed)
  6. Afterwards stop servers and `pg_ctl -D /opt/homebrew/var/postgresql@15 stop`.

## Handoff protocol (every session, no exceptions)

1. Update `WORK/WORK_STATE.md`: what was done, next 3 actions, blockers.
2. New verification results → new dated `WORK/AUDIT_*.md`; never edit old audits.
3. Working tree clean, no stray root files, no leftover worktrees/branches, servers stopped.
4. Commit and push. Report honestly what passed AND what failed, with RULES.md labels.

## Hard rules

- Never write secrets (VERCEL_TOKEN, keys, tokens) into any file.
- Never reference competitor POS/ERP brand names anywhere.
- Conventional commits; typecheck + tests must pass before committing.
- Product specs live in `docs/` and `contracts/` — do not duplicate them into WORK/.
- Clean up after yourself: no stray files at repo root, no leftover worktrees/branches.
